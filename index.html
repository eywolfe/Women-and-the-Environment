            <p class="subtitle">From Medicine to Botany</p>
            <p>
                Educated women in the 19th century were not well-regarded. Born in 1844, Kate Brandegee was a high-achieving woman that lacked a place for her intellect to thrive. She moved to California was she was nine years old and earned her medical degree at UC Berkeley. Despite her qualifications, Brandegee did not have much success in the field because, as reported by Marcia Myers Bonta in In Women in the Field: America’s Pioneering Women Naturalists, female doctors were not seen as legitimate at the time so she left medicine for her other passion: botany (Bonta, 85).

            <p class="subtitle">Included in the West, Hidden in the East</p>
            <p>
                Many institutions in the West included female scientists. As a botanist, Brandegee was offered a position at the California Academy of Botany in 1883. In comparison to the East, the Academy was relatively accepting of women: their policy was “ ‘we highly approve the aid of females in every department of natural history, and that we earnestly invite their cooperation,’ ” which was incredibly accepting and liberal for the time period (Bonta, 86 [ADD AS PRIMARY SOURCE]).
            </p>
            <p>
                Often the actions of Western scientists were influenced by their desire to be accepted on the East Coast, which influenced their acknowledgement of women. Although Brandegee participated in many publications, she was not given visible credit for her work because the Academy did not want her findings to be discredited in the East because she was a woman. For example, In Women in the Field: America’s Pioneering Women Naturalists by Marcia Myers Bonta, Bonta reports that when a New York botanical botanist found out that a publication with the initials “KB” were that of a woman, he relentlessly criticized Brandgee’s work. Her publications, therefore, were instead often under her husband’s name or that of her professor. All in all, Bonta describes Brandegee’s writing as “overlooked, even camouflaged, because she was a woman,” thus demonstrating a reason as to why it is hard to find publications written by 19th century women, particularly western women like Brandegee (Bonta, 85).  
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle">A Lasting Impact</p>
            <p>
                Similar to the plight of many women of her time, though Brandegee was hidden, her impact on her field is indisputable. Countless plants were discovered by her or named after her. Additionally, after an earthquake in 1906 destroyed the California Academy of Botany’s herbarium, Kate Brandegee and her husband donated their entire botanical collection and library to UC Berkeley. This generous donation gave the University a nearly complete collection of Western Pacific Coast flora—one hundred thousand plants in total (Bonta, 91).
            </p>
            <p>
                Like Brandegee, many 19th century western women were "camouflaged" due to pressures from the East and gender tensions nationwide. The way in which Brandegee was perceived regionally is indicative of how gender was perceived on the East and West Coast, and how the West Coast’s desire for legitimacy trumped its respect for women’s work in the field. Likewise, her story demonstrates why we cannot believe that women did not publish pieces or participate in environmental work simply because their names are not mentioned. There is a hidden narrative behind publications and Brandegee's story challenges us to seek it.

            <p>
                Though they may not have published their journals, many 19th century women naturalists thrived exploring untouched wilderness in solitude just as John Muir, an American naturalist and advocate of preservation who ventured primarily in the West, did. It was not socially acceptable, however, for women to go on adventures like Muir. In “Race, Class, Gender, and American Environmentalism” by Dorceta E. Taylor, Taylor writes that, while 19th century men mountaineering, hunting, fishing and other outdoor activities were praised among men, these endeavors were “frowned on when undertaken by women” (Taylor, 23). Society’s conflicting expectations for women thus created an obstacle for those who yearned to explore the unknown.

            <p class="subtitle">Secret Travels</p>
            <p>
                Due to society’s disproval of their expeditions, many women chose to explore and let few people know. Annie Montague Alexander (1867-1950) was an adventurous woman who grew up in Oakland, California. Like Muir, as reported by Marcia Myers Bonta in In Women in the Field: America’s Pioneering Women Naturalists, Alexander loved the outdoors with a fervent passion (Bonta, 51). Fascinated with paleontology, Alexander yearned to travel the discover new findings, but she had to face massive disapproval from her family. She wrote to her close friend, Martha Beckwith that her loved ones “ ‘do not seem to quite approve my new ambition. I do not want to be selfish yet it seems to me we have the right to a considerable extent of disposing our lives as we think fit;’ ” she was headstrong and would not let her family sway her from her passion (Bonta, 50 [ADD PRIMARY SOURCE]). As a result, Alexander often traveled without letting anybody know except for a few close friends. She subsequently took part in expeditions mainly in Hawaii, Oregon, Alaska, and Northern California.
            </p>
            <p>
                Society’s expectations of women like Alexander also seem to have influenced her legacy. Alexander collected many fossils, but seems to mostly be known for establishing the University of California Museum Paleontology and the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. Her role in the museums is notable and by all means a fantastic achievement; however, her work in museums posits her as more social acceptable rather than the Muir-like headstrong explorer.
            </p>
             <p class="subtitle">Redefining "Women's Work"</p>
            <p>
                Women also had duties at home that they were expected to fulfill. Martha Maxwell (1831-1881) was a Colorado naturalist and taxidermist. She became famous for her exhibit of stuffed wild animals titled “Women’s Work” at the Philadelphia Centennial in 1876, which pioneered the idea of habitat grouping in museum work (Bonta, 30). The collection is currently in the Smithsonian Arts and Industries Museum. Though accomplished, Maxwell was criticized for her feminine shortcomings. Marcia Myers Bonta in Women in the Field: America’s Pioneering Women Naturalists writes that, like Muir, Maxwell often camped outside alone and traveled to places such as California for her work—all of which were “very rough affairs” for a woman (Bonta, 35). She observed and hunted animals, engrossed in the behavior of wildlife, but despite her achievements, these attributes were viewed as shortcomings to those around her. In her book, Thanks to Abigail, Maxwell’s daughter, Mabel, wrote that Maxwell “ ‘lacked any very strong maternal qualities. They may have been swallowed up in her artistic and scientific interests’ ” as if Maxwell did not have the capacity to fulfill both her duties as a naturist as well as a wife and mother (Bonta, 35 [ADD PRIMARY SOURCE]).
            </p> 
            <p>
                Many women, such as Maxwell and Alexander, had the impulse to explore the untouched wilderness by themselves just as men like Muir did; however, women were not expected to act on this impulse, making it hard for them to explore and be given adequate credit for doing so. Women naturists, such as Alexander and Maxwell, subsequently pushed the boundaries of what it meant to be a woman in the 19th century. Their achievements are remarkable considering the barriers they were up against.
            </p>
            <p class="subtitle">Women Were There</p>
            <p>
                It is also important to note that women also subtly influenced men like Muir. In “Race, Class, Gender, and American Environmentalism,” Dorceta E. Taylor claims that “some of the most revered male environmentalists of the period—Thoreau, Olmsted, and Muir—had female friends who played important roles in directing, mentoring, or shaping their intellectual growth and political activism” (Taylor, 23). In addition to recognizing that Muir had little-known contemporaries that approached the study of nature like he did, one must also note that women also influenced what men like Muir did. One cannot give credit to men like Muir without acknowledging the role of those around him in his work.

                <p><span class="headline hl6">1907-1964</span></p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Possibly the most famous figurehead of women in environmentalism, Rachel Carson’s monumental books made the ability of women to analyze complex environmental issues indisputable.  Carson worked for the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries after receiving her masters in zoology from Johns Hopkins University.  She eventually became a federal ecologist, and the editor-in-chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Having previously written many articles, Carson published her first book, Under the Sea-Wind, in 1941.  She wrote many influential books and articles, the most famous of which are The Sea Around Us and Silent Spring.
            </p>
            <span class="citation2">
                "It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself." - The Sea Around Us
            </span>
            <p>
                She found the most success and influence with her 1962 book, Silent Spring.  In this book Carson expresses her concern for wildlife, and questions the effects of the widespread use of pesticides.  Carson carefully frames these environmental issues in an accessible way, describing how they affect ordinary Americans.  Because of this approach, Silent Spring prompted public outcry about the ever increasing pollution and use of pesticides in the US.  In the aftermath of this book, Carson even testified before Congress to demand stricter health and environmental policies.

            </figure>
            <p>
                Carson’s writings faced stark criticism, much of which included overt and covert sexism.  Most of these attacks were personal, rather than a critique of her writing.  Critics claimed that she was unscientific, disloyal, and a communist.  Some tried to link her to “faddists” and radicals.  At the time women were seen as less rational than men, and this carried into criticisms of Carson.  She was described as “hysterically overemphatic” and as having a “mystical attachment to the balance of nature” in one review in Time magazine.  Even positive reviews of her books painted Carson in a domestic light, as shown by a Life magazine editorial that features a picture of her on a nature walk with her children.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the sexist criticisms that she faced, her books were overall quite influential.  She won the John Burroughs Medal for The Sea Around Us, which discusses the ocean from a scientific and poetic perspective.  On accepting the award she argued for the respect of her craft, stating “if we are the true spirit of John Burroughs, or of Jefferies or Hudson or Thoreau, we are not imitators of them but—as they themselves were—we are pioneers in new areas of thought and knowledge. If we are true to them, we are the creators of a new type of literature as representative of our own day as was their own” (94).

                In part influenced by this historic book, environmental issues came to the forefront of American politics in the 1960s and 1970s.  Membership in environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society, and the Wilderness Society increased by about 500,000 members in the sixties.  Carson was an important part of the broader movement that included issues relating to the urban environment, community, home, and humans.  The success of Carson’s writing also inspired and opened the door for the next generation of female environmental authors.

                <span class="headline hl3">A Born Naturalist: Brenda Peterson</span>
                <p><span class="headline hl4">1950 - present</span></p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The closeness that Brenda Peterson feels to the Earth and all of its beings is rare.  She developed this relationship in early childhood, having lived in a remote cabin in the Sierras with her Forest Serviceman father until the age of seven.  She describes this with eloquence in Nature and Other Mothers.  “I first memorized the forest with my hands, crawling on all fours across prickly pine needles.  Like a blind girl’s reading braille, my stubby fingers traced sworls of pine bark, searching for congealed sap.  I’d chew its fragrant pine gum -- more flavorful than any bland baby food.”  With this rugged upbringing, Peterson would have been less influenced by traditional societal expectations for women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nature and Other Mothers cements Peterson as a unique point of view in the environmentalist community.  As a child, Peterson thought it was “obvious” that all plants and animals - including humans - were related.  Because of this, she viewed trees as our elders.  Using this idea as a foundation Peterson describes the wisdom and strength of old trees, often blurring the line between human and tree.  Like Thoreau, she forms an anti-capitalist view and argues for the inherent value of life.  She laments “The nowadays notion that people, like parts, are replaceable and that old parts are meant to be cast aside for newer models is a direct result of an industrial age that sees the body and the Earth as machines.”
            </p>
            <p>
                She uses this personification and evaluation of nature to motivate her criticism of logging.  Peterson blames the economic motivations of logging, pointing out that the individual loggers seem to appreciate trees as she does.  She notes that “They, too, grew up in the forest; their small hands also learned that bark is another kind of skin.”  
            </p>
            <p>
                The casual, storytelling style of this selection camouflages the complex connections and metaphors that Peterson makes.  She references the viewpoints of many other cultures, including Paganism and some native tribes.  She compares the death of her grandfather to death of an old-growth tree, remarking that both have invaluable wisdom.  “Old trees like old people survive the ravages of middle-age competition for light or limelight; they give back to their generations more oxygen, more stories; they are tall and farsighted enough to see the future because they are so firmly rooted in the past.”  This chapter which starts as a description of her childhood eventually delves into sharp criticism and investigation; “As a nation are we still so young, do we still worship what is newborn or newly invented so much that we will be eternal adolescents, rebelling against the old order of trees or people?”

                Ann Zwinger initially did not intend to become an environmental author.  After receiving a degree in Art History from Wellesley College she married Herman Zwinger, an Air Force pilot.  They eventually settled in Colorado, and Ann focused on raising their three daughters.  Ann developed her appreciation for nature through interaction with her vacation home in the Colorado mountains.  Still unaware of her future as an environmental author, she systematically sketched and catalogued the plants on their land.  Ann eventually developed a desire to write about the landscape that she loved so much.

            <figure class="figure">

            </figure>
            <p>
                In 1969 she was introduced by a friend to Rachel Carson’s agent, Marie Rodell.  With Rodell’s encouragement, Zwinger published Beyond the Aspen Grove in 1970.  She eventually published more than twenty books about a huge variety of natural places.  Many books were accompanied by her own detailed sketches of the plants she was describing.  Ann passed away in 2014, having won some awards for her writing and contributed pieces to many nature magazines. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Beyond the Aspen Grove, Ann displays her distinct ability to interleave personal experience in nature with ecological observations.  Her descriptions are detailed but not clinical, reflecting the style of her field sketches.  [TODO: insert scan of sketch].  She portrays the landscape with care and affection, acknowledging that it has existed and will persist much longer than humans.  She muses,
            </p>
            <span class="citation2">
                "But when the lake has finally been absorbed, and the rock is surrounded and covered by soil, then perhaps larger animals will come padding and pawing and nosing about, their ancestors even now roaming the woods."
            </span>
            <p>
                Ann also uses her family’s vacation cabin as a microcosm of her ideal society.  Her ideal of not altering nature is similar to Muir, though she is more open to people living in nature.  She described her family’s effect on the nature around them, stating “We have tried to understand the patterns of the land at Constant Friendship.  We have hoped to change it as little as possible.  After all, we are only visitors to this mountain land.”
